# Personal Website
Personal website I made with React, TypeScript and Styled Components. Hosted on Vercel. Building the website and pushing changes as we speak, so feel free to check out my progress from time to time!

## What I Learned
This was my first project adding a dark theme toggle and conditionally styling elements. I really enjoy the simplicity and seamless transitions with the dark mode toggle.
